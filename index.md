## First blog using Jekyll markdown on GitHub Pages 

I am a SQL Server DBA with varied interestes. I will try to write here as often as I can to primarily help myself solidify my thinking. But I will also document my observations here which ranges from SQL Server to Powershell, automation, DevOps and leadership, and from time to time I will share my struggles and thoughts :-)
